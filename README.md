# Work-Loop
Work Loop is a simple app made with the help of front end web development (HTML,CSS,JavaScript) which helps a user to organise and list their pending work at one of the same place.
This would help  a user to keep track of their pending work and they can  also personalize which work is to be kept at top priority and which at low.
